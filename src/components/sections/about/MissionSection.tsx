              At RoboSpark, we're on a mission to transform how children
              interact with technologyâ€”from passive consumers to active
              creators. We believe every child deserves the opportunity to
              develop the technical fluency, creative problem-solving abilities,
              and collaborative mindset needed to thrive in an increasingly
              technology-driven world.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Founded by educators and engineers passionate about equitable STEM
              education, RoboSpark bridges the gap between play and learning
              through carefully designed robotics experiences that make complex
              concepts accessible and engaging for all children.
